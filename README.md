# MDP-Jan-2015
This is home to our great project
* Download git for windows/mac from http://git-scm.com/downloads
* Open Git bash, cd to your preferred folder 
* Clone the project with command: git clone git@github.com:phuc10cdt2/MDP-Jan-2015.git
* Make changes to the folder as you progress
* After finish one change, add changes to the local directory with command: "git add -A"
* commit the changes: git commit -m "Your messages about changes come here"
* push the changes to repository so that every one can see: git push
* Want to see the changes of others: git pull
* If 2 of you changed the same files, there may be conflicts. Google to know how to solve the conflict and commit again :)
* Try not to make changes to the same files as it causes a lot of headache
* Good luck!
